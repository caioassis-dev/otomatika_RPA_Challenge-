# 🤖 Otomatika RPA Challenge 🤖
Automate the process of extracting data from a news site.

### The Challenge
* Your challenge is to automate the process of extracting data from a news site.
You should push your code to a **public** Github repo, and then use that repo to [create a Robocorp Control Room process](https://robocorp.com/docs/courses/beginners-course-python/12-running-in-robocorp-cloud). The process should have a completed successful run before submission. Make sure to [write your files to the `/output` directory](https://robocorp.com/docs/courses/beginners-course-python/9-collecting-the-results#saving-the-file-to-the-output-directory) so that they are visible in the artifacts list.

### The Source
* You are free to choose from any general news website, feel free to select from one of the following examples.

- https://apnews.com/
- https://www.aljazeera.com/
- https://www.reuters.com/
- https://gothamist.com/
- https://www.latimes.com/
- https://news.yahoo.com/


### Parameters

* The process must process three parameters via the robocluod work item

- search phrase
- news category/section/topic
- number of months for which you need to receive news (if applicable)
    
    > Example of how this should work: 0 or 1 - only the current month, 2 - current and previous month, 3 - current and two previous months, and so on
    > 

These may be defined within a configuration file, but we’d prefer they be provided via a [Robocloud workitem](https://rpaframework.org/libraries/robocorp_workitems/)


### The Process

The main steps:

1. Open the site by following the link
2. Enter a phrase in the search field
3. On the result page
    
    If possible select a news category or section from the 
    
    Choose the latest (i.e., newest) news
    
4. Get the values: title, date, and description.
5. Store in an Excel file:
    - title
    - date
    - description (if available)
    - picture filename
    - count of search phrases in the title and description
    - True or False, depending on whether the title or description contains any amount of money
        
        > Possible formats: $11.1 | $111,111.11 | 11 dollars | 11 USD
        
6. Download the news picture and specify the file name in the Excel file
7. Follow steps 4-6 for all news that falls within the required time period

Specifically, we will be looking for the following in your submission:

1. Quality code
Your code is clean, maintainable, and well-architected. The use of an object-oriented model is preferred.
    
    We would advise you ensure your work is [PEP8 compliant](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)
    
    Employ [OOP](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)
    
2. Resiliency
Your architecture is fault-tolerant and can handle failures both at the application level and website level.
    
    Such as using [explicit waits](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/waits.html) even when using the [robocorp wrapper browser for selenium](https://rpaframework.org/libraries/browser_selenium/python.html)
    
3. Best practices
Your implementation follows best RPA practices.
    
    Use proper [logging](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html) or a suitable third party library
    
    Use appropriate [string formatting](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/python-string-concatenation) in your logs (note we use python 3.8+)
